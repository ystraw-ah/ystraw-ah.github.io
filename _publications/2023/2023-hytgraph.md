  In this work, we propose a hybrid transfer management approach to take the merits of both the two approaches at runtime, with an objective to achieve the shortest execution time in each iteration. Based on the hybrid approach, we present HyTGraph, a GPU-accelerated graph processing framework, which is empowered by a set of effective task scheduling optimizations to improve the performance.
