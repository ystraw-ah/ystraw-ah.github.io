  We propose Ingress, an automated system for incremental graph processing. Ingress is able to incrementalize batch vertex-centric algorithms into their incremental counterparts as a whole, without the need of redesigned logic or data structures from users. Underlying Ingress is an automated incrementalization framework equipped with four different memoization policies, to support all kinds of vertex-centric computations with optimized memory utilization. We identify sufficient conditions for the applicability of these policies. Ingress chooses the best-fit policy for a given algorithm automatically by verifying these conditions.
