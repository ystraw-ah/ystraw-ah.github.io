abstract: >-
  We present GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and designing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses.
