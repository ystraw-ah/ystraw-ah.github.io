abstract: >-
  Existing RAG tools typically use a single retrieval method, lacking analytical capabilities and multi-strategy support. To address these challenges, we introduce NeutronRAG, a demonstration of understanding the effectiveness of RAG from a data retrieval perspective. NeutronRAG supports hybrid retrieval strategies and helps researchers iteratively refine RAG configuration to improve retrieval and generation quality through systematic analysis, visual feedback, and parameter adjustment advice.
