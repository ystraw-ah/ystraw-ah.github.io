  We present NeutronTP, a load-balanced and efficient distributed full-graph GNN training system. NeutronTP leverages GNN tensor parallelism for distributed training, which partitions feature rather than graph structures. Compared to GNN data parallelism, NeutronTP eliminates cross-worker vertex dependencies and achieves a balanced workload.
