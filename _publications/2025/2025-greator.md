  We propose a topology-aware localized update strategy that exploits the locality of small-batch updates to reduce unnecessary I/O and computation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight graph topology to efficiently identify affected nodes without full index scans and adopt a localized update mechanism that confines index modifications to only the affected file pages, thereby greatly reducing unnecessary I/O overhead. Moreover, we design a similarity-aware local connection method that links each affected node to a small set of the most similar neighbors in the deleted nodeâ€™s local region, reducing redundant connections and avoiding expensive pruning.
