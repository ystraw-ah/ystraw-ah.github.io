  In this work, we propose a hybrid transfer management approach that takes the merits of both two transfer approaches at runtime. Moreover, we present an efficient vertex-centric graph caching framework that minimizes CPU-GPU communication by caching frequently accessed graph data at runtime. Based on these techniques, we present HytGraph, a GPU-accelerated graph processing framework, which is empowered by a set of effective task-scheduling optimizations to improve performance.
