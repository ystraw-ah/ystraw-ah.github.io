  We propose a metric function to evaluate the effectiveness of vertex processing order in accelerating iterative computations.  Leveraging this metric, we propose a novel graph reordering method, GoGraph,  which constructs an efficient vertex processing order. Additionally, for evolving graphs, GoGraph implements incremental adjustments to vertex order during batch updates of edges. we further propose a metric function designed to evaluate the effectiveness of vertex processing orders in response to graph changes and provide three optional methods for dynamically adjusting the vertex processing order.
