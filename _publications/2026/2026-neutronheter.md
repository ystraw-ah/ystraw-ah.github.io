  We present NeutronHeter, an efficient GNN training system for heterogeneous clusters. Our system leverages two key components to achieve its performance, including a multi-level workload mapping framework that transforms the complex multi-way mapping problem into a top-down workload mapping on a tree-like resource graph, and an adaptive communication migration strategy that reduces communication overhead by migrating communication from low-bandwidth links to local computation or high-bandwidth links.
